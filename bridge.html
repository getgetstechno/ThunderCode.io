      <p class="mb-3">In our second year, we undertook several engineering projects across various fields. Here, I'll explain how we constructed a suspension bridge using only MDF wood. The bridge needed to support a total weight of 260 kg over a span of 3.4 meters.</p>

        <h4 class="title_text"><strong>Introduction</strong></h4>
          <div class="column_image">
            <img src="img/suspensionbridge/bridge.png" alt="bridge" style="width:70%">
          </div>
          <div class="text_text">
            To begin, we faced specific constraints. The bridge's total length and segment lengths were predetermined, restricting our design options. Additionally, the use of materials other than MDF was prohibited, meaning even the suspension cables had to be made from wood segments. This project spanned 6 days spread over 6 weeks, involving a team of 5 engineering students. Ultimately, the bridge would undergo load testing. Each segment's deflection had to stay within 1% of its length.
            <br><br>
            The bridge needed to be structurally sound while using minimal material. Excessive material would be wasteful, while too little would compromise its strength, potentially leading to failure and unnecessary costs. Despite these constraints, we had creative freedom to design an efficient and effective structure.
            <div class="column_image">
              <img src="img/suspensionbridge/design.png" alt="bridge" style="width:60%">
            </div>
            We opted for a suspension bridge with tall, leaning pylons towards the anchor points, aiming to counteract central deflection with additional force from the pylon mass center. We minimized support on the pylons for aesthetic reasons, necessitating careful design to avoid moments on the pylons and ensure their structural integrity.
            <div class="column_image">
              <img src="img/suspensionbridge/test.png" alt="bridge" style="width:60%">

        <h4 class="title_text"><strong>MDF</strong></h4>
          <div class="text_text">
            Our initial step involved gathering data on the MDF's properties through tensile testing, identifying its elastic and plastic regions, Young's modulus, ultimate tensile strength, and yield stress.
            <div class="column_image">
              <img src="img/suspensionbridge/mdf.png" alt="mdf properties" style="width:60%">
            </div>
            With this data, we began designing the bridge. Using principles learned in structural analysis, we calculated the static forces and moments, then determined the pylon and cable dimensions accordingly. The hanging cable's shape was crucial and derived from the moment diagram of a linear beam under distributed load, adapted for our segmented wood sections.

          </div>  
          <div class="text_text">
            Extensive calculations followed, with iterations to refine our design decisions. Ultimately, we developed a Python script to automate these calculations, though its complexity posed challenges, especially with considerations for leaning pylons and uneven segment heights.
            <br><br>
            Once our program was operational, we visualized and analyzed the bridge's dimensions using tools like Geogebra and SCIA to ensure structural stability and validate deflection limits.

            Another aspect of this project was designing the drone's frame. It was first designed in Fusion 360 before being printed using the 3D printers at VUB. To achieve the best design, we had to minimize the amount of PLA used while ensuring the frame was stiff enough to withstand all the forces. To do this, we used the stress analysis function in Fusion 360. Several prototypes were made, as shown in the following pictures. Another important feature is that, based on some dimensions and the forces and moments the object will endure, it is possible to let Fusion generate the best possible part.

            In the end, our design looked like this. We added a basket underneath to carry the vaccines, as this was our primary objective.

          <div class="text_text">
            After assembling and printing all the parts, we achieved the desire result. We conducted several test flights and had opportunities to make some improvements. On the final day, we went to an aeroclub to test our autonomous drone in real safe conditions. It worked quite well but crashed after a few takeoffs. From the log files, we couldn’t determine exactly what caused the drone to crash. Overall, we were quite happy with our experience. Like our other projects, this one gave us many opportunities to improve our knowledge and problem-solving skills.
